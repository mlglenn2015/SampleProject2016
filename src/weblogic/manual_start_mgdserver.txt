To start managed servers, use either startManagedWebLogic.cmd
or startManagedWebLogic.sh, as appropriate for your environment.

Usage instructions:

   (1) If you are starting the managed server from a remote machine,
       use the Configuration Wizard to create a domain.  This will
       ensure that you have all files needed to start the server.

   (2) Navigate to your domain bin directory and execute the following:

   (3) For details about servers defined in domain, look in the Admin Console
       or in config/config.xml.

       startManagedWebLogic.cmd my_managed_server http://<administration_server_host_name>:7001   (Windows Example)

       startManagedWebLogic.cmd my_managed_server http://[http://<administration_server_host_name>:7001]:7001   (Windows IPv6 Example)

       Please make sure the listen-address for the administration_server_host_name_ipv6
       is same as its config.xml while starting managed servers.


For ease of reference, you defined the following managed
servers in your domain:

    stocksMgdServer1


    cd C:\Oracle\Middleware\wls12212\user_projects\domains\mydomain\bin
    startManagedWebLogic.cmd stocksMgdServer1 http://localhost:7001
